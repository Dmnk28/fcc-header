# Request Header Parser Microservice

This Request Header Parser Microservice returns information about the requesting system.

Since this is a freeCodeCamp-Project of mine its limited in functionality to the tasks demanded by the corresponding [certification project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/request-header-parser-microservice).

Try my solution by following the path [[base URL]/api/whoami](https://fcc-header.dmnk28.repl.co/api/whoami)

It will return something like:
{"ipaddress":"::ffff:172.18.0.1","language":"en-GB,en;q=0.5","software":"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:100.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/100.0"}
